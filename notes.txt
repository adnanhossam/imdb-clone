this a notes only txt file 
this is a project of a clone website of the imdb website 
and in this file we are are going to display are train of thoughts so every time we resume the project we get
up to speed of where we left 

first of all 
we need to think about the apps layout and how we are going to partition the code into apps based on the 
separation of functionality

1- now we have the app the is going to manage admin , superuser and its authorizations
            we are going to call this the admin app 
2- an app to manage the home page and the extension of the home page to other pages
3- an app to manage the user authorizations and authentication , login , logout & signup pages 
4- an app that is going to manage the apis that handel the data flow from and to the database 


now that we have built the project and theadmin and users apps 
we need to manage the user authentication



back after a while
a quick update , now we have created some templates using chatgpt for the home feed and the user authentication
and done the required urls , and the home feed looks nearly identical to the original imdb website
and now we need to start a new app that is going to be responsible for the library of the movies/shows
and how to do crud operations on them using the basic django model/view/template way and not the restfull api way 
after that we are going to add some users and handle the authorizations oN them 
we can call this app the library 
yesterday all the models for the movies artists and all of that 
now we need to seperate them in diffrent apps and build the crud opperation views for them 
we can make an app for the movies and tvshows persay & an app for the rest 
or we can make an app for each of them 
i see that 5 to 6 apps for them alone is alot of mess regarding the configurations, the number of files and importing and so on
not to mention that we may need to make other apps 
what to name it ?
we can call one cast wich will contain all the cast personel & the other products for the tvshows and movies
and actually we can make it 3 apps rather than 2 for the sake of making a dedicated app for the many to many relations 
maybe that could make any sense for the maintaining of the code after that
ok , i don't see that to have importance because the mannytomany relations are made from the products to they are already seperated
in the 2 apps idea
